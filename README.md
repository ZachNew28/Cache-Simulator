This program simulates a CPU cache for the LC2K processor. As the processor simulator executes an assembly-language program, it will access instructions and data. These accesses will be serviced by the cache, which will transfer data to/from memory as needed. The purpose of this project is to get familiar with cache design and how a caching processor generates and services address references.
